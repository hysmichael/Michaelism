An articulation of the criterion to preclude an agent’s moral responsibility is essential to answering the compatibility problem of determinism and free will. Once the criterion is settled, we can examine if determinism entails this criterion so as to resolve if determinism is compatible or incompatible with free will that suffices moral responsibility. Harry Frankfurt and Derk Pereboom ended up with opposing answers to the compatibility problem in light of their thought experiments, primarily due to their disagreement about the abovementioned criterion. Harry Frankfurt disproves the efficacy of the criterion that an agent being not able to have done otherwise precludes its moral responsibility (I denote this criterion as Lack of Alternate Possibilities Criterion, or simply LAP) and suggests a compatibilist view. Derk Pereboom, on the other hand, demonstrates the criterion that an agent’s action being the product of a deterministic process outside its control precludes its moral responsibility (I denote this criterion as Deterministic Process Criterion, or simply DP) and then defenses his hard determinist (incompatibilist) stance. This paper will first discuss the thought experiments employed by both philosophers as means of argumentation and then analyze the battleground of the clashing theories introduced by these thought experiments.

In Harry Frankfurt’s “Alternate Possibilities and Moral Responsibility”, he conceives of a person Jones<sub>4</sub> who might perform a certain action. He also conceives of another figure Black who wants Jones<sub>4</sub> to perform that exact action. Black does not interfere with Jones<sub>4</sub>’s internal rationale unless Jones<sub>4</sub> is detected to have any inkling of thoughts that might lead to his not performing the action. In that case, Black will take effective steps to ensure that Jones<sub>4</sub> will actually perform his desired action. However, it turns out that Jones<sub>4</sub> initially prefers to perform that action, even if the potential interference imposed by Black does not exist. Jones<sub>4</sub>’s decision to perform the action, out of his own reasons, necessitates he being morally responsible, despite he could not have done otherwise (even could not choose otherwise) under the leverage of Black. Frankfurt elaborately designs this experiment to be dissectible. When considering whether Jones<sub>4</sub> should be held morally responsible, we consider his rationale and intention in absence of Black’s external intervention. Conversely, when considering if Jones<sub>4</sub>’s circumstances satisfy LAP, Black’s external intervention overshadows the efficacy of Jones<sub>4</sub>’s internal propensity. After both parts are intuitively accepted, Frankfurt has succeeded in convincing us that LAP is actually compatible with moral responsibility because Jones<sub>4</sub> is just a cogent example where someone bears moral responsibility even though not able to have done otherwise. Though not evident in Frankfurt’s text, he seems also to claim that under the premise that LAP is all that determinism entails, compatibility of determinism with moral responsibility logically follows from compatibility of LAP with moral responsibility.

Derk Pereboom, in response to Frankfurt’s theory, acknowledges his strong and resilient thought experiment for building a compatible view between moral responsibility and LAP. However, as a hard determinist, he refuses to compromise on compatibility between moral responsibility and DP or hard determinism. The thought experience he uses is a series of four scenarios in which an imaged character Mr. Green committed a murder. The four scenarios are similar in the sense that they all try to offer an explanation for Green’s motivation but they are configured in such a way that the explanation transits from more specific and imaginary ones gradually to more general and realistic ones. In Case 1, Green is created and manipulated by neuroscientists to commit the murder. In Case 2, instead of direct manipulation, neuroscientists have programmed him at birth as a rational egoist, which eventually leads to the murder. In Case 3, instead of fictional neuroscientists, the rigorous milieu where he grew up determined him to be a rational egoist, which eventually leads to the murder. In the final Case 4, instead of instantiating a particular deterministic factor, it directly supposes the truth of physicalist determinism, because of which Green is rationally egoistic and eventually commits the murder. The last case corresponds to DP where one person’s action is causally determined by factors beyond its control.

It would be much harder to convince the readers the lack of moral responsibility in the last scenario were the first three cases not provided as sub-steps. The absurdity of direct neural manipulation in Case 1 intuitively eliminates moral responsibility of the subject. Once the obvious case is accepted, Pereboom pushes readers bit by bit through more obscure cases. The difference delta between any two adjacent cases is controlled to be not qualitative but only quantitative because a quantitative alternation seems to be unprincipled to flip our previous intuition. For example, from Case 1 to Case 2, only the length of the temporal interval between the programming and the action is extended, and Pereboom persuades us that this extension is irrelevant to the moral responsibility in question; therefore, Green is not morally responsible in Case 2 the same as what we believed in Case 1. Just because Pereboom pays careful attention to controlling the gap between adjacent cases so that every step is small enough to be intuitively continuous and conceivable, once we reach the final case along the given route, we are almost certain that DP precludes moral responsibility that Green should be excused since his action results from a deterministic causal process that traces back to factors beyond his control. This conclusion might seem to be counter-intuitive when we scrutinize our ordinary moral judgments. Pereboom crisply rejects this intuition by arguing its wrong basis, in particular denial or negligence of determinism. Self proposed objection and rejoinder like this further reinforce the hard determinism arguments of Pereboom.

As effectively shown by Frankfurt and Pereboom by thought experiments, we regard it true that DP precludes moral responsibility while LAP fails to do so. Despite my appreciation for both of the thought experiments, I am unsatisfied by the ambiguity when Frankfurt attempts to advance from the compatibilism argument about LAP and moral responsibility to the compatibilism argument about determinism and moral responsibility. I am inclined to agree with Pereboom because his arguments built upon the criterion of DP sounds more like what determinism actually means. As pointed out in his objection to Frankfurt, determinism implies the stronger criterion DP and the weaker criterion LAP in the sense that the stronger criterion DP is a sufficient and necessary condition for determinism while the weaker criterion LAP does not imply determinism in this reverse direction. Frankfurt shows that when people bear moral responsibility, LAP can hold. But according to Pereboom, LAP does not imply determinism so that determinism does not have to hold in this case. And in fact, we can interpret the case of Jones<sub>4</sub> in a way so that exactly LAP holds but determinism does not hold. Jones<sub>4</sub> is not able to have done otherwise under the potential control of Black but he could have his free personal intention that is not causally determined that just happens to coincide with Black’s intention. Were Jones<sub>4</sub>’s intention and internal rationale causally determined, he would satisfy the criterion of DP and be exempt from moral responsibility as stated by Pereboom, but this is not specified in the original configuration of the thought experiment. Therefore, Frankfurt’s thought experiment of Jones<sub>4</sub> does not undermine the hard determinist view of Pereboom.

On top of the objection by Pereboom to Frankfurt, let us further consider the relationship between determinism and the criterion to rule out an agent’s moral responsibility. Frankfurt, after refuting LAP as an effective criterion, proceeds to claim that an agent is not morally responsible if he did what he did only because he was unable to do otherwise. This criterion  (denoted as only-LAP might as well) aligns with DP of Pereboom as two distinctive criteria for the preclusion of moral responsibility. Obviously, the coexistence of two criteria for a single property complicates the judging process. Hence I would like to propose a unified criterion for the property in question that can be compatible with both only-LAP of Frankfurt and DP of Pereboom. I claim that an agent is exempt from moral responsibility if all the factors that constitute its rationale for its behavior is external to its control (I name this criterion as External Rationale Criterion, or simply ER). Consider DP of Pereboom, if an agent’s action is the product of a deterministic chain beyond its control, then all the factors that constitute its rationale must be causally determined and thus external to its control. Therefore, DP implies ER. Then let us consider only-LAP of Frankfurt. The causes to a subject’s action consist of personal intentions and external constraints. The reason that Jones<sub>4</sub> is morally responsible is that he does not behave only under external compulsion; there exists some portion of the causes that is internal and subjective to him. For that reason, if only-LAP holds for some subject, that subject lacks internal intention and is fully compelled by external compulsion beyond its control. That is to say that only-LAP implies ER.

Now, we have the sole criterion ER to preclude an agent’s moral responsibility. The compatibility problem between determinism and free will that suffices moral responsibility boils down to the satisfiability problem of ER in the context of determinism. Pereboom, as a hard determinist, regards that determinism necessitates DP, which necessitates ER and thus determinism is incompatible with moral responsibility. On the contrary, Frankfurt mentions in his “Freedom of the Will and the Concept of a Person” that it is conceivable that a person’s ability to have free will is casually determined and in whichever case determinism is irrelevant to the satisfiability of ER. So, determinism can be compatible with free will. As far as we concern, the fundamental divergence between Frankfurt and Pereboom, as well as many other philosophers, might not lie in the criterion to preclude an agent’s moral responsibility as long as we can find a universal template to reconcile differently configured criteria. It is more dependent upon their different hypotheses of the significance of determinism and what it actually entails. Furthermore, determinism is neither unanimously agreed to cause the lack of moral responsibility, nor is its only possible cause, for the reason that there might be many other circumstances unrelated to determinism that can satisfy ER, for example, only-LAP, as we proved in the previous paragraph. On that account, it seems that given the elaborate argumentations of Frankfurt and Pereboom, the compatibility question between determinism and moral responsibility is still far from the ultimate answer, or the ultimate answer simply does not exist.
