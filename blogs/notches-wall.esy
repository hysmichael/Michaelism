It was the same routine every time I entered Grandpa’s apartment. I’d greet him briefly while he rummaged out a pencil and a hardwood plank from the Mahjong table. Then, I’d reluctantly take off my shoes and stand against the wall, tolerating the pressure of the plank on my head and the scratching noise of the pencil. It was silly to keep measuring my height this way; but Grandpa seemed to enjoy it as he stood back to scan the wall, gently beaming beneath his wrinkles.

Despite my resentment to the practiced routine, I’m much concerned about Grandpa’s happiness. When I was three, he was involved in a terrible motorbike accident. My memories aren’t distinct; only a great figure appears in front of me, whisking me out of the way of the vehicle. Though doctors applied the best medical care, Grandpa didn’t fully recover from his coma. Losing a clear mind afterwards, he soliloquized and gibbered a lot, regardless of his audience. I struggled between the desire to communicate with him and the frustration with not being able to. Saying “I love you” was easy, but the obstacle of Grandpa’s mental condition seemed to block his awareness.

Though I tried to convince Grandpa that I was a teenager now who no longer needed be measured like a child, deep down, I felt abashed toward my behavior because I sensed the significance of the seemingly silly routine to him. I may never know why Grandpa loves the wall so much, but I could try. I put myself in his place to admire the wall, scrolling upwards through the elapsing dates, increasing measurements, and less blurred characters of names - some of mine, some of my cousins’. I imagined leaden pencil lines and sapphire pen notches were the treasure chest of his pride for family. The wall as a whole must be a tangible history of family for him. My own series of notches were simply a part of this great family history Grandpa was proud of. If one mark could indicate one moment when a child came back to share time with him, then I wanted to show Grandpa my respect for his routine through this limited channel.

Previously, I’d just seen my marks as measurements of my height, but now they gave me a new perspective on my own pride. I began to see my past achievements reduced into series of pencil marks; the competitions nationwide, my myriad of experiences in social activities and my whole teenage ego, were just notches. But, Grandpa’s esteem for the wall reminded me that though the notches are small, my family treasures them. For that, I’m lucky. It’s from my family that I also learned the value of humility. Grandpa saved my life, but if that wasn’t enough, he persisted in swimming for fifteen years after accident. Compared to Grandpa, my past achievements were really just pencil marks. Humility inspires me to put my pride aside and focus on what matters most to me: connecting with Grandpa and having a balanced perspective on my own life.

Gazing at some newly drawn lines hovering around the same place, I admit I didn’t grow recently. But I firmly believe that I will complete the large space above my line of markings. The wall challenges me to continue climbing to new heights, maybe not literally, but in my achievements. Yet, it also grounds me by implying that any of my achievements should be measured in a larger context, my immediate family and the global “family”. In this case, the wall is no longer a record of my physical growth, but more important, of my mental growth.
