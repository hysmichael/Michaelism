“This was supposed to be a story of how Chinese parents are better at raising kids than Western ones”[REF *= Chua, Amy. Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother. New York: Penguin Press, 2011.] preludes the 2011 bestseller Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother written by a Chinese immigrant mother Amy Chua. This offensive sentence instantly caught the eyes of media nationwide and articles commenting on the “superiority” of Chinese parents appeared overnight. Then, people from all walks of life joined a heated debate over the consequences of tiger parenting, many trying to discredit the purported superiority of Chua’s tiger parenting out of a disgust towards Chua’s conceit, some others narrating personal anecdotes to defend it. Scholars also provided their perspectives through research on the academic, psychological, and social outcomes of tiger parented adolescents. However, few people seem to have noticed the second sentence in the preface: “But instead, it’s about a bitter clash of cultures, a fleeting taste of glory, and how I was humbled by a thirteen-year-old”[REF *= Chua, Amy. Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother. New York: Penguin Press, 2011.]. Instead of praising the effectiveness of tiger parenting, this might be the actual focus of Chua’s writing. So, similar to what Chua suggests here, this paper tries to complement the discussion over tiger parenting by focusing on the experience of immigrant tiger parents instead of the consequences of tiger parenting. The phenomenon of tiger parenting actually prompts us to inquire into the struggles and strivings of Chinese immigrant families for retaining connections with the heritage culture, succeeding in the new country and mollifying collisions across different cultures.

<b> Background and Definition of Tiger Parenting </b>

Before we start off analyzing Chinese immigrant families through the lens of tiger parenting, it is necessary to clarify its definition. The concept of tiger parenting was first introduced in Amy Chua’s Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother. Throughout the book, Chua described how she used tiger parenting to raise her daughters, Sophia and Louisa, to achieve academic success, mastery of musical instruments and competence in social settings, but she didn’t articulate its definition. As a result, the definition of tiger parenting was largely shaped by what the journalists quoted from her book. The most popular quotation was the ban list  from the beginning of the book, which comprises ten clauses no less rigorous than mathematical proofs that constrain Chua’s daughters’ freedom of choice mainly in extracurricular activities. Even without further analysis, readers of these articles were prone to regard tiger parenting as harsh and inhumane, which finally led to a wildly held conception of tiger parenting as a tiger like highly pressured, highly regulated parenting style. The tiger parents were usually interpreted as emperors in their families, exerting arbitrary power on their children and causing excessive academic pressure or even “lifelong [psychological] scars”[REF *= Su, Lac. “‘Tiger Mothers’ leave lifelong scars” CNN Opinion. Jan. 2011. n.p. 9 Feb 2014.].

On the other hand, the scholars from University of Texas at Austin gave a slightly different definition that tiger parenting is a parenting style where parents execute high responsiveness and high demandingness when parenting their children[REF *= Kim, S. Y.; Wang, Y.; Orozco-Lapray, D.; Shen, Y.; Murtuza, M. “Does ‘tiger parenting’ exist? Parenting profiles of Chinese Americans and adolescent developmental outcomes.” Asian American Journal of Psychology, 4(1), 2013, 7-18.]. It is clear that the discussion around the high demandingness part of tiger parenting dominated the conversation. The voices backing the responsiveness side of tiger parents were rare. One of the most believable arguments was from Amy Chua’s elder daughter Sophia Chua. She candidly admitted her mother’s harshness but also emphasized the kindness, warmth and support behind it. According to her description, her family has a joyful and carefree family life similar to other American families; her mother never reserves her praises if she tries her best doing something. For tiger parents who lack the encouraging side, Kim et al. categorized them into a new category “harsh parenting”, which is relatively uncommon (about 8%) among Chinese immigrant families. Therefore, this paper adopts the definition of tiger parenting as a highly demanding while highly encouraging parenting style. It better reflects the parenting behaviors of Chua as well as other representative Chinese immigrant parents.

For most journalists and scholars, the purpose of elucidating the definition of tiger parenting was to evaluate it more objectively in a precisely defined scope. However, the evaluation of tiger parenting based on its new definition concurred with its prevalent preconception: a statistical research showed that “[tiger parenting] does not lead to optimal adjustment among Chinese American adolescents”[REF *= Kim, S. Y.; Wang, Y.; Orozco-Lapray, D.; Shen, Y.; Murtuza, M. “Does ‘tiger parenting’ exist? Parenting profiles of Chinese Americans and adolescent developmental outcomes.” Asian American Journal of Psychology, 4(1), 2013, 7-18.]; a critical column argued that “[tiger moms] obviously infringe on a number of basic human rights”[REF *= Li, Charmaine. “Does Tiger Parenting Work?” The Vancouver Sun. Mar. 2011. n.p. 5 Mar. 2014.]. Denouncing tiger parenting was one’s freedom, but most critics solely attributed all the consequences of tiger parenting to the “harsh, discouraging, and ruthless” immigrant parents without further inquiries about what circumstances resulted in their choice of parenting style. In sociology, blaming an action only onto the person who executed the action is called “retributive justice”, which most criticisms of tiger parenting could be categorized into. To the contrary of retributive justice, the theory of “restorative justice” – “[an action] has both individual and social dimensions of responsibility” [REF *= “Retributive vs. Restorative Justice.” Conflict Solutions Center. n.d. n.p. Web. 5 Mar. 2014. http://www.cnn.com/2011/OPINION/01/20/lac.su.tiger.mother.scars/] – is a more holistic approach to explaining the occurrence of a specific behavior and is favored by more scholars. If we apply the theory of restorative justice to the analysis of tiger parenting, tiger parenting should also have both individual and social dimensions of responsibility. Whether tiger parenting yields benign results or not, it urges us to focus on the personal struggles and strivings of immigrants families as well as the more general social contexts of immigration.

<b> Racial Integrity: Retaining Connections with the Heritage Culture </b>

“Recently, immigrants encounter different challenges as they try to adjust [to the new culture] while maintaining their cultural identity”[REF *= McDonald, Hellen G.; Balgopal, Pallassana R. "Conflicts of American immigrants: assimilate or retain ethnic identity." Migration World Magazine, Vol. 26(4), May-June 1998, 14-18.]. Without exception, immigrant parents face a similar dilemma when forming their parenting styles. If their parenting style largely inherits from the heritage culture, their children might face difficulties integrating to the new culture; in reverse, if their parenting style is assimilated to the new culture, their children might lose the connection with their heritage.

The practice of tiger parenting reveals that Chinese immigrant parents still hold many traditional Chinese ideals about child rearing and education even when living in a place not of their origin[REF *= Chen, H. “Parents’ attitudes and expectations regarding science education: Comparisons among American, Chinese-American, and Chinese families.” Adolescence, 36(142), 2001, 305–314.]. The responsiveness of tiger parenting reflects parental responsibilities; the demandingness of tiger parenting reflects the expectation that “children achieve for their family”[REF *= Huntsinger, C. S.; Huntsinger, P. R.; Ching, W. D.; Lee, C. B. “Understanding cultural contexts fosters sensitive care giving of Chinese American children.” Young Children, 55(6), 2000, 7–12.]. Furthermore, the emphasis on practicing towards perfection reflects a belief in hard work. All of these ideas are well treasured by Chinese culture and originate from Chinese philosophers, particularly Confucius[REF *= Guo, Karen. “Ideals And Realities In Chinese Immigrant Parenting: Tiger Mother Versus Others.” Journal Of Family Studies 19.1 (2013): 44-52. Academic Search Premier. Web. 3 Feb. 2014.], as well as the ideologies of Chinese society formed gradually throughout history. For example, parents’ responsibilities toward their children and children’s responsibilities toward their families are both derived from Confucian thought on the interdependence nature of Chinese families[REF *= Huntsinger, C. S.; Huntsinger, P. R.; Ching, W. D.; Lee, C. B. “Understanding cultural contexts fosters sensitive care giving of Chinese American children.” Young Children, 55(6), 2000, 7–12.].

The continuation of Chinese traditions in tiger parenting reflects the dialectical approach of Chinese immigrant parents toward Chinese and American parenting styles. Instead of fully accepting the individualism in American parenting which “emphasizes fostering children’s independence from parents”[REF *= Cheah, Charissa S. L.; Leung, Christy Y. Y.; Zhou, Nan. “Understanding ‘Tiger Parenting’ Through the Perceptions of Chinese Immigrant Mothers: Can Chinese and U.S. Parenting Coexist?” Asian Am J Psychology, 4(1), March 2013, 30-40.] and giving children unstructured freedom, tiger parents tend to agree with “granting their children freedom along with established rules and guidance”[REF *= Cheah, Charissa S. L.; Leung, Christy Y. Y.; Zhou, Nan. “Understanding ‘Tiger Parenting’ Through the Perceptions of Chinese Immigrant Mothers: Can Chinese and U.S. Parenting Coexist?” Asian Am J Psychology, 4(1), March 2013, 30-40.]. Amy Chua’s ban list aforementioned is a fairly extreme example, where more rules are formulated and less freedom is granted. In contrary, most Chinese immigrant parents who identify themselves as tiger parents chose to have looser rules and grant more freedom to their children. Under this dynamic balance between being assimilated to the American parenting style and persevering with the Chinese parenting traditions, tiger parents strive to sieve the parenting essences out of both cultures according to their own criteria and then fuse them into a more “well-rounded” parenting style. This parenting style is also committed to rousing the children’s awareness of the merits of their heritage culture. In a research conducted with Canadian Chinese parents, the parents claimed: “children who grow up in Chinese culture are generally motivated to pursue excellence”[REF *= Li, J. “Expectations of Chinese immigrant parents for their children’s education: The interplay of Chinese tradition and the Canadian context.” Canadian Journal of Education, 26(4), 2001, 477–494.]. For Chinese immigrant families, tiger parenting artificially builds up a semi-Chinese culture in order to help their children learn positive characteristics featured by the heritage culture without much conscious effort. 

Retaining connections with the heritage culture is not only for the sake of worthwhile traditional values, but also for maintaining the relationships with other immigrant Chinese families in America. All in the same foreign country with the same cultural heritage, sharing the same experience of immigration, immigrant families have irreplaceable values to each other. Especially for immigrant families that lack connections with the mainstream society, other immigrant families are their best resources in the new country. However, in the huge ecosystem of a foreign country, these connections are delicate and largely built upon the mutual identity as Chinese. To sustain this mutual identity, it is vital for immigrant parents to behave scrupulously according to the moral standards from the heritage culture in order not to lose the mian-zi  of anyone. In Chinese culture, “if a child misbehaves or fails in studies, parents are often the ones to be criticized for spoiling their child or not having taught their child right”[REF *= Chen, F. M.; Luster, T. “Factors related to parenting practices in Taiwan.” Early Child Development and Care, 172(5), 2002, 413–430.]. In these cases, parents lose their mian-zi. Thus, tiger parents fulfill their duties as parents as defined culturally by not spoiling their children and teaching them the basic rules for appropriate behaviors to protect their own mian-zi. Under the peer pressure of other immigrant families and in order to gain more mian-zi, it is understandable that tiger parents will use all ways they deem right to help their children.

Though immigrant families value their connections with other immigrant families, it is undeniable that they are still eager to participate in the mainstream society and build strong connections with it. Some immigrant parents failed to do so because of the language barriers. Others, who can speak relatively fluent English and try building social connections in all variety of settings, might also feel their effort ineffective. This is because “trying to adapt to the dominant society, predominantly white Anglo-Saxon Protestant, is difficult when one’s skin color or facial features differ from ‘the norm’”[REF *= McDonald, Hellen G.; Balgopal, Pallassana R. "Conflicts of American immigrants: assimilate or retain ethnic identity." Migration World Magazine, Vol. 26(4), May-June 1998, 14-18.]. An immigrant mother even claimed that “the impossibility of her son becoming a pure New Zealander requires her to help him keep his Chinese identity” according to a research study on the New Zealand Chinese immigrants[REF *= Guo, Karen. “Ideals And Realities In Chinese Immigrant Parenting: Tiger Mother Versus Others.” Journal Of Family Studies 19.1 (2013): 44-52. Academic Search Premier. Web. 3 Feb. 2014.]. Similarly, for some Chinese immigrants in America, after experiencing the failure of complete integration into the dominant society and the consequent disappointment, they come to realize the importance of keeping their “racial integrity”[REF *= Guo, Karen. “Ideals And Realities In Chinese Immigrant Parenting: Tiger Mother Versus Others.” Journal Of Family Studies 19.1 (2013): 44-52. Academic Search Premier. Web. 3 Feb. 2014.]. Had the children of immigrant families eventually failed to fully immerse into the mainstream society and also lost their connections with the heritage culture, they would have fallen into an identity predicament where they could not be accepted by either culture. To avoid this precarious ending, tiger parents rectify the behaviors of their children according to the traditional Chinese ethics while simultaneously letting their children attempt their acculturation and social immersion. Whatever the immigrant children wind up to identify themselves as American, Chinese American, or Chinese, tiger parenting intends to prepare the children for all these possibilities. 

If there are no barriers for second-generation immigrants to mix into the dominant society, if they can always end up becoming Americans, not Chinese Americans that are usually considered separate from the dominant white Americans, the needs for tiger parents instilling the heritage culture might diminish. This reflects the reluctance of the dominant society to accept ethnic minorities, while this reluctance results from “the inherent and acquired biases [towards the minority]”[REF *= McDonald, Hellen G.; Balgopal, Pallassana R. "Conflicts of American immigrants: assimilate or retain ethnic identity." Migration World Magazine, Vol. 26(4), May-June 1998, 14-18.]. In this sense, the negative criticism of tiger parenting as ruthless, inhumane, problematic[REF *= Khazan, Olga. “The Problem With the Triple Package: Why Immigrant Parents Aren't Superior.” The Atlantic. 28 Jan. 2014. n.p. 5 Mar. 2014.], or ineffective, whether intentionally or objectively, could defame the image of Chinese Americans in the dominant society and help to deteriorate the biases towards Chinese immigrants. Notice that no such article about tiger parenting explicitly states racial discrimination, but because racial discrimination now is rooted in stereotypes and biases, most of them actually aid and abet racial discrimination toward Chinese Americans.

The racial discrimination and reluctance to accept ethnic minorities apply to every minority groups. However, tiger parenting addresses another racial discrimination only toward Asian Americans. Asian Americans, usually having better education and living situation than other minority groups, are deemed as the “model minority”, “a bright, shining example of hard work and patience whose example other minority groups should follow” ("The Model Minority Image"). But on the other hand, compared to other ethnic groups, Asian Americans are assessed by a higher standard in processes like college admission in order to maintain a racial variety and balance. This double standard is unequivocally stated in the book No Longer Separate, Not Yet Equal: “if all other credentials are equal, Asian-Americans need to score 140 points more than whites, 270 points higher than Hispanics, and 450 points above African-Americans out of a maximum 1600 on the math and reading SAT to have the same chance of admission to a private college”[REF *= Golden, Daniel. “Harvard Targeted in U.S. Asian-American Discrimination Probe.” Bloomberg. 2 Feb. 2012. Jonathan Kaufman. 16 Mar. 2014.]. Facing this “positive” discrimination toward Asian Americans, Chinese immigrant parents are urged to raise more successful children than the already high Asian average in order to win the competition with other Asian Americans. In short, tiger parenting is the byproduct of two kinds of hidden discrimination toward Chinese immigrants and Chinese Americans. To get at the root of the matter, the society should not shirk its responsibility of pointing out and resolving the racial discrimination hidden behind tiger parenting.

<b> Immigration Project: Succeeding in the New Country </b>

Most researches on tiger parenting were conducted within the time frame of the adolescence of the second generation. They compare the academic outcome and psychological wellbeing of the children with that of their contemporaries in major ethnic groups. Or they focus on analyzing the mindsets, social relationships, and financial situations of their parents within that specific time frame. It is very rare that the time frame is prolonged so as to include the whole immigration experience of the immigrant parents. However, neglecting the broader picture of immigrants’ life trajectory might lead to fallacy and oversimplification in the comparison between immigrant families and other non-immigrant families because we try to apply a uniform standard to evaluating the behaviors of two sets of people with completely distinctive life backgrounds and pursuits.

Moreover, a scholar offered a different perspective to understand the motivation behind tiger parenting: “the many efforts [tiger parents] make to create a successful life for their children are useful ways in which parents realize their own immigration aspirations”[REF *= Guo, Karen. “Ideals And Realities In Chinese Immigrant Parenting: Tiger Mother Versus Others.” Journal Of Family Studies 19.1 (2013): 44-52. Academic Search Premier. Web. 3 Feb. 2014.]. It means that for some immigrant parents, realizing their initial aspirations for immigration takes more than one generation. Inspired by this hypothesis and with the life trajectory of immigrant parents in mind, I introduce a concept of immigration project here. The immigration project is the whole process of immigration from the day one conceives the idea of immigration all the way to the day one or one’s posterity realizes the initial immigration aspiration.

The immigration project has a start, which is the initial immigration motivation for Chinese immigrants. Some Chinese want to immigrate because of their perception that “developed countries are more democratic and less competitive than China”[REF *= Kwong, P.; Chen, E. “Chinese Americans.” In E. Chen & G. Yoon (Eds.), “Encyclopedia of Asian American Issues Today” (Vol. 1, pp. 15–20). Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, LLC.]. Others have aspirations for a better life in America, especially better education and better future for their children. The immigration project also has an end. The end is the moment when the dreams in the initial motivation have been realized. For “democracy”, since “the cultural and ethnic diversity of the new immigrants was not readily welcomed within the political, economic and societal context [of America]”[REF *= McDonald, Hellen G.; Balgopal, Pallassana R. "Conflicts of American immigrants: assimilate or retain ethnic identity." Migration World Magazine, Vol. 26(4), May-June 1998, 14-18.], to enjoy the democracy that initially spurred some to immigrate requires considerable acculturation and social recognizance from the dominant society. For “better life and success in the new country”, immigrant families are required to have effective connections with the mainstream society and be fairly treated when competing with non-immigrant families for higher socioeconomic status and actual success in the new country.   As a result, I define the end of the immigration project as a complete integration, a status that immigrants might not be considered as immigrants any more, fully acculturated to the new culture and recognized by the mainstream society. The racial discrimination mentioned in the previous section prevents immigrants from actually realizing complete integration but it doesn’t prevent immigrants from viewing complete integration as their ultimate goal and striving to reach it as near as possible. 

After defining the start and the end of the immigration project, let us consider the length of the project. According to the study on acculturation, “[immigrant] mothers perceived more difficulties than their children to be fully acculturated”[REF *= Buki, Lydia P.; Ma, Tsung-chieh; Strom, Robert D.; Strom, Shirley K. “Chinese immigrant mothers of adolescents: Self-perceptions of acculturation effects on parenting.” Cultural Diversity and Ethnic Minority Psychology, Vol. 9(2), May 2003, 127-140.]. So, the immigration project is a highly demanding task to be completed within the first generation usually because first-generation immigrants have language barriers and ingrained cultural idiosyncrasy. The second-generation immigrants usually do better because they’re born in the new country and are exposed to English and American culture growing up. Therefore, the immigration project usually spans across generations and consists of the inaugurating strivings of the immigrant parents, the continuation of the mission to the second generation (i.e. parenting) together with endeavors of both generations, and finally a new cycle starting from the second generation.

Parenting is an indispensible stage of the immigration project to pass down the torch from generation to generation. Tiger parenting reflects the struggles of immigrant parents to secure this passing process and preserve all the existed progress. Recall the experience of finding a job: after passing countless paper tests and preliminary interviews to the final interview, any rational job seeker would spare one-hundred-percent attention and effort during the final interview, and exhibit firm self-demands and exorbitant expectations of getting the offer. Similarly, large percentage of immigrant parents are either international students who spent considerable effort in studying and finally gained American citizenship after years of arduous studying, researching and working, or financial immigrants who laboriously started their new lives by operating Chinese restaurants, or working as manual workers. After years of strenuous life, they eventually earned their own places in the new country. The ambitious yet nervous emotion before they started parenting their children does not have essential difference with the emotion of the final-round interviewee aforementioned. 

Consequently, tiger parenting is more understandable with a general immigration project in mind. Every effort of tiger parents attributes to their desire to ace the project succession down to the next generation. Their experience taught them the “upward social mobility”[REF *= Guo, Karen. “Ideals And Realities In Chinese Immigrant Parenting: Tiger Mother Versus Others.” Journal Of Family Studies 19.1 (2013): 44-52. Academic Search Premier. Web. 3 Feb. 2014.] of education and hard work, so they put enormous emphasis on the education of their children and expect their children to work harder than surrounding people to reinforce the upward social mobility. They exploit all possible methods to “prepare [their children] for the future, letting them see what they’re capable of, and arming them with skills, work habits and inner confidence”[REF *= Chua, Amy. “Why Chinese Mothers Are Superior.” The Wall Street Journal. 8 Jan. 2011. n.p. 5 Mar. 2014.]. In addition, they urge their children to understand the fact that their lives in the new country were established on top of years of hard work and the ultimate aim of complete integration hasn’t been achieved yet. Through a combination of expectation, encouragement, high demands, tiger parents expect their children to comprehend their responsibility in continuation of the immigration project (achieve for family, as stated before), but at the same time are apprehensive that their children might disregard their benign intentions, fail in academic or profession, and smash the hard-won progress towards complete integration. If this apprehension is too overwhelming, tiger parents, viewing from their standpoint as the dominator of the whole immigration project, might come to believe “they know what is best for their children” (what is best for progressing in the project), and therefore “override all of their children’s own desires and preferences”[REF *= Chua, Amy. “Why Chinese Mothers Are Superior.” The Wall Street Journal. 8 Jan. 2011. n.p. 5 Mar. 2014.]. This radical measure reveals tiger parents’ uncertainty about the future and extreme fear towards failure. Imagine for the first generation immigrants who sacrificed the best youth of their lives to seek immigration, how disappointed they would be if they couldn’t see their initial dreams realized by themselves or their children, grandchildren at the end. In this sense, tiger parents, though suffering harsh criticism, still deserve understanding and respect.

<b> Harmonic Family: Mollifying Collisions across Different Cultures </b>

As discussed before, tiger parents integrate effective parenting approaches and cultural perspectives from both cultures. However, it is impossible for them to control the behaviors of their children who largely absorb the ideology from school as well as the broader American society. The internal conflicts between cultures for immigrant parents themselves are not hard to be settled, but the dissention between the more heritage-culture-oriented parents and the more host-culture-oriented children is usually unavoidable.

One of the dissentions is between individualism and family responsibility. “Family in Confucian thought revolves around two notions: the collectivist tradition, and the ethic of filial piety”[REF *= Guo, Karen. “Ideals And Realities In Chinese Immigrant Parenting: Tiger Mother Versus Others.” Journal Of Family Studies 19.1 (2013): 44-52. Academic Search Premier. Web. 3 Feb. 2014.]. The filial piety is especially important when children are involved in their parents’ immigration project. In tiger parenting, high regulation and expectation is the practice to cultivate children’s filial piety. Though Confucius defined filial piety as the absolute obedience of children under their parents, Chinese immigrant parents often look forward to the understanding, respect, and cooperation from their children with a loose definition of filial piety. Opposed to an Olympic champion swimmer answering the interview question, “who’s your hero?” seemingly confidently with “I am”, blogger Hasson argued, “her arrogant self-absorption represented a huge parenting failure, no matter how great her Olympic achievement.” If unbridled individualism might result in narcissism, greed, and self-absorption as Hasson suggests here, it is quite visionary for immigrant parents to blend it with collectivism by tiger parenting. Additionally, the filial piety for immigrant families is not restrained to the families themselves; it is also applicable to the general Chinese American community. The social status of all minority Chinese Americans can be elevated if and only if all the individuals have the “filial piety” for the whole community and sacrifice some individualism in order to reach the target of social recognition and political discourse through unified social activism.  

However, tiger parenting might incur irreconcilable confrontations between parents and their children. Amy Chua once burst into tears and insanely dashed across the Red Square when she failed to force her daughters play violin during their trip to Russia[REF *= Chua, Amy. Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother. New York: Penguin Press, 2011.]. The battles broken out between tiger parents and their children require much effort to reconcile. It is even fatal to immigrant parents who feel foreign in the outer society because of insufficient acculturation. To them, the only place they can call home, the only place they feel belonged to and feel relaxed at, is now filled with the smoke of war. In this circumstance we urge immediate mediation from the local community, and in general we appeal for more day-to-day concern from the local community towards Chinese immigrant families.

<hr>

Within all the analysis around the struggles and strivings of Chinese immigrant families through the practice of tiger parenting, we have a clearer portrait of the population of Chinese immigrants when they connect with the heritage culture, crystalize parenting wisdom from different cultures, struggle with the implicit racial discrimination, aspire for success and better life in the new country, repose the halfway accomplished dream on their children and locate their position in the community. It is clear now that tiger parenting is not as simple as an arbitrary decision made by the immigrant parents; it is an outcome of the convoluted interactions between immigrants’ heritage culture, the immigration context, and the environment of the host society. Aside from solely discussing the consequences of tiger parenting, the American society should give the most basic respect and understanding to these hardworking dream seekers and, to some extent, admirable parents. Especially, in light of restorative justice, if the society continues ranting on negative evaluation of tiger parenting and merely condemning the contextual behaviors without seeking more fundamental social changes and offering more directed help to immigrant tiger parents, the society is more ruthless than the ruthless tiger parents.
