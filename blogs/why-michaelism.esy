Welcome to my new blogging site (though it’s out of my vanity to say “new” here because I never had one before, but who says “new” can only denote recreation but not mere creation, if this is the case, how the hell life will be for engineers slash CS 107 students who work on pointers). Yeah, right, I know you’re now imaging (or, with a tremendously higher probability, you’re cursing about my ridiculous logic, emancipated imagination, chaotic writing style, and wondering what the heck the p-word is (I mean, for sure, innocently, “pointer”)) the line of code “Blog *my_blog = new Blog()”, which seems ridiculous at the first sight; but, I bet you will accept its legitimacy if you’ve ever been familiar with its ultimate fantasy-form “Girl *girl_friend = new Girl(/*parameter omitted*/). Anyway, this preamble is way too long-winded, but this is undeniably my style. Whether you like this or not, I don’t care. (NG, I do care.) I just wanted to create a suspense here but it seems like English (or Chinese) does not support this function. This is the reason why I learned Japanese, because then you can append the verb and its negation-conjugation at the end of the sentence and say, with the mysterious tone Kojima Haruna used for her speech at this year’s General Election, “I :: Whether you like my blog or not :: Car~~e”. (みんなこのブログに気に入るかどうか、僕は気にしていまー(pause for 5 seconds)ーす).

So, back to the introduction of my blog. I dubbed it “MICHAELISM” because I have to give it a name (slapped >), because, I was inundated by “-ism” words throughout this quarter in my philosophy class and this is the time when Newton’s law of inertia applies to something other than physics. I do think my flow of thoughts and the essences slash garbages contained (yeah, I admitted there are garbages. If the DNA of human beings can contain 99% garbage then at least I’m sure the garbage rate of my blog will be at least higher than that) are representative of my life philosophy, and I do hope to share these with everyone given that you are willing to give your precious s*** to me (Jk). Now, when I type Michaelism, there still comes the annoying red wavy underline, so one of my life ambitions is just, simply, get rid of this line for all the computers with their pre-installed operating systems in the world (oops, what about the International Space Station, let’s say, entire universe, counting the spacecraft Matthew McConaughey is piloting).

The last thing, my blog is going to be multi-lingual, so please refrain from bombarding me if you could not understand anything for some of my blogs. The working languages will be English, Chinese and Japanese, and I guess these are enough because they already covered the top three countries on the GDP chart (though this is not an accurate prediction that the fourth language that I will learn is German). I’m trying to digress from monochromic and bland academic writing in my blog and give my English a chance to be naughty, willful and unbounded (just like the way I talk, unscrupulously and sometimes stupidly, if you happen to be my friend on campus). Also, I would like to sustain my ability to write Chinese essays (ok, more precisely, “type”) and practice my Japanese writing skills. I just found that I really like languages (expressing, bull***ing, witticism, humor, comedy..). In particular, I just love talking and writing and accordingly I told my friends that these two skills are in my bucket list for my life with the highest priority. So here I come, as a qualified student, but totally unqualified writer, unqualified comedian, unqualified polyglot (I HATE THIS WORD because I said I would like to be a “polygamist” at frat rush). But this is better than making no noise at all and just letting everything rotten inside my mind, isn’t it.

Yeah, welcome to “MICHAELISM”, welcome!.
