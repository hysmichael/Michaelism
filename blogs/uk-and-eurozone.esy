The Euro, only celebrating its seventeenth birthday this year, has become the second most important international currency after the US dollar. It takes up 20.34 percent share of total official foreign exchange reserves [REF *= Data from IMF International Financial Statistics (IFS). Figure mentioned is the latest data (2015Q3). ], and also 16.7 percent of the total value of currencies traded daily in the global exchange market. [REF *= Data read from Graph 1 in Triennial Central Bank Survey (2013).] This single currency, shared by sixteen countries in the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), is breaking down borders between people, companies, and markets. It also contributes to the integration of the power of all these individual nation-states, after thousands of years of conflicts and separations on this ancient continent. Despite all these, one profound “imperfection” of the Eurozone is the absence of the UK, the second largest economy by GDP in Europe. The British, clinging to its pound sterling which carries much of the country’s pride, refused and is going to remain refused the adoption of the euro. But why? Does a united currency with the greater Eurozone not endow the UK with a much larger free market, fewer trading hassles and cheaper credits? As I would like to discuss in this paper, the UK is not playing headstrong in front of the invitation from the Eurozone. Instead, it is an observant and scrupulous bystander that, having been disillusioned after several accidents prior to the introduction of the euro, tactically declined the invitation and departed on a track that moves further and further away from joining the Eurozone.

The gestation period of the single currency for Europe has been so long that it could be dated well back to the WWII. In 1944, when the WWII was raging but approaching its end, the Bretton Woods Conference was held in New Hampshire, United States to prepare for the postwar rebuilding of the international economic system. The so-established Bretton Woods system obligates all participating countries, including Western Europe, Japan, etc., to peg their currencies to the US dollar on an exchange rate fixed within a plus-minus 1 percent band, where the US dollar is convertible to gold at $35 per ounce. This fixed exchange rate system is aimed to stabilize all major currencies then, and also to prevent competitive devaluation. However, accumulation of public debt and monetary inflation from the 40s to the 60s caused the Nixon government unilaterally severed the convertibility of US dollars into gold in 1971, and the Smithsonian agreement enlarged the floating band for the exchange rate to plus-minus 2.25 percent. In other words, the maximum possible fluctuation between any two European currencies can reach 9 percent. [REF *= According to the Smithsonian agreement, the floating band was set to plus-minus 2.25 percent. At the extremist, one European currency X could increase 4.5 percent in value with respect to US dollar, and another European currency Y could decrease 4.5 percent in value with respect to US dollar. So even within the narrow band, currency X could actually increase 9 percent (or equivalent, currency Y could decrease 9 percent) in value with respect to currency Y (to currency X).]

This implied instability and an increasing distrust of the US government’s compliance with the new agreement from the French and the German, eventually led to the establishment of a new regional arrangement within the European Economic Community (EEC) – Snake in April 1972, which stipulates a fluctuation band of plus-minus 2.25 percent between EEC-member currencies. The UK was not in EEC when Snake was introduced. But as a prospective member to join the EEC, the UK, Ireland and Denmark joined Snake one week after. The British was generally confident in making this move. An internal Bank of England document recognized the political nature of the process, “… [the objective is] to create a Europe that could stand up to the economic might of the US … [and] to develop a role for European currencies with which to oppose the monetary dominance of the US dollar.” Yet, such confidence floundered soon after the UK joined Snake. The German Bundesbank started to raise interest rate, which resulted in a wave of international selling of the pound. Despite arduous attempt to prop up sterling above the lower bound, depleting the Treasury and Bank of England’s $2.6 billion reserves in a week, the UK was forced to leave Snake in June 1972. Nevertheless, the UK was admitted into EEC (now EU) in January 1973.

The second time when the British were considering re-joining the European monetary mechanism was 14 years later. In 1986, when sterling fell from DM3.60 to DM2.85 due to plunging oil prices [REF *= DM stands for Dutch Mark, the former official currency of West Germany (1948-1990).], then Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson thought joining the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) [REF *= The Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) was introduced in March 1979, as part of the European Monetary System (EMS). It requires all member currencies to be pegged to European Currency Unit (ECU), and the fluctuation of exchange rate fixed within 2.25 percent margin.], established in 1979 in replacement of Snake, would enable the UK to take advantage of “the credibility of the Bundesbank to get inflation down.” Britain joined the ERM, just days after the fall of the Berlin Wall in October 1990. But it turned out that this was indeed an inappropriate time to join, again. Against a backdrop of severe economic downturn with declining GDP in both 1991 and 1992, the UK was hit by an erupted foreign exchange upheaval in 1992. On 16 September 1992, now known as the Black Wednesday, the British Conservative government was forced to withdraw the pound from ERM, for it could no longer keep the pound above the agreed lower limit in the ERM. Britain’s $20 billion foreign exchange reserves evaporated within a passage of few hours. This second ejection, to some extent, permanently stifled Britain’s further attempt to peg pounds to the European mechanism, and later on, the adoption of the single currency euro.

Historical blunders taught the British a lesson that forsaking its own independent monetary policy could lead to catastrophe. Pegging pound to the European Currency Unit (ECU) [REF *= ECU was introduced as part of EMS. It was a basket of the currencies of European Community member states. It was replaced by Euro, on 1 January 1999, at parity. It was not real currency like euro, and did not circulate either.] with a fixed band cripples British government’s ability to devalue its currency in order to boost the economy in financial emergencies. Similarly, yielding the right to set monetary policy, most importantly the interest rate, to the European Central Bank (ECB) would undermine the government’s ability to regulate the UK economy. This was even more evident after the 2009 European debt crisis. Surely the UK’s banks were devastated as badly as banks in countries like Greece or Ireland during the crisis, and the recovery could only be long and slow. Nevertheless, it would be much worse were the UK in the Eurozone and Bank of England not able to cut its interest rate to historic lows and devalue its currency. Unaffordable bank bailouts, economic collapse, sovereign defaults and austerity measures – all of these, as happened to Greece and Ireland, might as well happen to the UK during the crisis, given the UK’s soaring level of household debt prior to the crisis.

Joining the Eurozone is literally riding a frail boat with all other Eurozone nations, over a wide span of economic prosperity and robustness. The failure of one country drags down everyone on the boat into water, so joining the Eurozone assumes responsibility for helping the weak economies in Europe, which is exactly what the UK does not feel obliged to do. After the 2009 crisis, Greek government received two bailouts worth 240 billion euros, from the troika of European Commission, the ECB, and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) [REF *= Data from the NY Times’ article “Greece Reaches a Deal for More Bailout Money”.]. Most of ECB’s bailout fund came from creditors of the strongest economy in Europe, Germany. The UK is clear that it has to contribute an even huger amount to these bailouts if its fate is tied with the malfunctioning economies of some European nations. This potential sacrifice is certainly over-stripping the benefits that a unified euro market could bring about. Furthermore, even the latter benefits are less and less appealing to the UK when the UK has been long shifted its focus from the European market to the global market as a whole, valuing the US market and the Asian market (especially, China) more than the European market.

So far I have dissected the UK’s reluctance to join the Eurozone from an economic perspective. No doubt, there are also huge obstacles political wise. Three polls conducted from 2011 to 2012 [REF *= Refer to note (63), (64), (65) of Wikipedia entry “United Kingdom and the euro”.] all showed that more than 80 percent of the British people are against adopting the euro. Thus it is definitely not a popular act to propose such initiative for any British politician. Moreover, critics argue that a single currency would eventually lead to a single government of EU, which aggravates the doubt. Actually, the UK politicians had long been articulating their intention not to join the Euro. The UK treasury, under then the Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown of the Labour Government, drafted “five economic tests” in October 1997 as five conditions that they thought should be satisfied before the UK’s readiness to join EMU. These five conditions were just too demanding to be satisfied. Most speculated its intentionality, and believed that it just provided an economic justification as a smokescreen for the UK’s fundamental lack of political readiness to join. Later, the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government elected in May 2010 pledged not to adopt euro for the lifetime of the Parliament. [REF *= Refer to BBC News’ article “Conservative-Lib Dem deal”.] Some guess that the UK’s deliberate circumvention around the euro essentially indicates its special stance in the political tensions among the US, the continent Europe and itself.

Besides, there might even be identity reasons, entrenched deep down within the British. According to German finance minister Peer Steinbruck, “I don’t believe that the UK will be in EMU in ten years. Britain’s self-awareness, its identity and its self-definition are not really those of a country that believes it is part of Europe.” The Britain’s distinct identity is likely to underwrite all other reasons for its reluctance. But one step back, regardless of all the economic, political and cultural reasons I discussed above, even if the UK is willing to join Eurozone, it <em>couldn’t</em> possibly join without considerate sacrifice on its current economy. This is because the UK does not satisfy the convergence criteria for its application to join the Eurozone to be considered. In 2014 ECB Report, the UK’s budget deficit is 5.8 percent of GDP, where the maximum limit is 3.0 percent. The UK’s debt-to-GDP ratio is 90.6 percent, where the maximum limit is 60 percent. [REF *= Data from European Economic Forecast (2014).] The extent of budget cut and fiscal policy changes is deemed impossible for the UK government to implement in short term.

Just recently, we know that the UK plans to hold a referendum in June 2016 on whether it should leave the EU. This signals that the UK intends to depart further from the European continent, not only the currency euro. The memory of yore is doomed to be forgotten, including all the scathes and contentions around a single European currency. With all the reasons given above, especially after the UK having undergone the turbulence of the financial crisis in 2009, it seems a completely wise decision of the UK to remain out of the Eurozone. At the same time, I believe that such decision will remain unchanged unless some outstanding changes happened to the economic and political climate regarding euro and the Eurozone.
